A multi-agent system for Starknet blockchain interactions with isolated memory and configuration for each agent. This project enables autonomous agents to interact with Starknet contracts, manage resources, and execute complex strategies independently.

This project allows running multiple agents simultaneously, each with its own configuration for API keys, Starknet wallet addresses, and private keys. Each agent operates independently with isolated memory and blockchain interactions.

## Features

- Run up to 4 agents simultaneously in autonomous mode
- Each agent has isolated memory and vector storage
- Individual Starknet wallet configuration for each agent
- Dashboard integration for monitoring agent activities
- Support for both autonomous and manual (interactive) modes
- Color-coded console output for easy agent identification
- Chromadb vector storage for agent memory persistence
- MongoDB integration for dashboard data storage
- Phala Network TEE integration for enhanced security and privacy

## Dashboard Demo

For a visual interface to monitor your agents in real-time, check out the demo dashboard project:

ðŸ‘‰ **[ds-agents-dashboard](https://github.com/defi-space/ds-agents-dashboard)**

The dashboard provides:
- Real-time monitoring of agent thoughts and actions
- Agent status tracking
- Transaction history
- Detailed agent profiles
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

To enable dashboard integration, set `ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"` in your `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for running ChromaDB and MongoDB
- Starknet RPC access
- Google API keys for each agent

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/defi-space/ds-agents.git
   cd ds-agents
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Create your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys, wallet addresses, and private keys.

5. Start the required services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file contains configuration for all agents. Each agent must have its own:
- Google API key
- Starknet wallet address
- Starknet private key

Example:
```
# Agent 1 Configuration
AGENT1_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
AGENT1_ADDRESS="your-wallet-address"
AGENT1_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Agent 2 Configuration
AGENT2_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
AGENT2_ADDRESS="your-wallet-address"
AGENT2_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# ... more agent configurations ...

# Starknet
STARKNET_RPC_URL="your-starknet-rpc-url"

# GraphQL Indexer
INDEXER_URL="http://your-indexer-url:8080/v1/graphql"

# Google API Key used for embedding in single agent mode
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Optional: Enable dashboard integration
ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"
DASHBOARD_URL="http://localhost:5173"  # URL to the ds-agents-dashboard
```

> **Important**: Each agent must have its own configuration. The system no longer supports using a single shared wallet address or private key.

## Running Agents

### Run All Agents Simultaneously (Autonomous Mode)

```bash
bun run start-all
```

This will start all 4 agents in parallel, with output from each agent prefixed with its name. All agents will run in autonomous mode.

### Run a Specific Number of Agents

You can run a specific number of agents (from 2 to 4) using the following commands:

```bash
bun run start-agents-2  # Run 2 agents (agent1 and agent2)
bun run start-agents-3  # Run 3 agents (agent1, agent2, and agent3)
bun run start-agents-4  # Run 4 agents
```

You can also specify the number of agents directly:

```bash
bun run src/run-agents.ts 4  # Run 4 agents
```

### Run Individual Agents (Autonomous Mode)

You can also run agents individually in autonomous mode:

```bash
bun run start-agent1
bun run start-agent2
bun run start-agent3
bun run start-agent4
```

### Run an Agent in Manual Mode

To run an agent in manual mode (interactive CLI), add the `--manual` flag:

```bash
bun run src/agents/agent1.ts --manual
```

In manual mode:
- You'll get an interactive command prompt
- You can type messages and get responses from the agent
- The agent won't run autonomously
- Type `exit` to quit the session

## Architecture

### Agent Factory Pattern

The system uses a factory pattern to create agent instances with different configurations:

```
createAgent(config) â†’ Agent Instance
```

Each agent:
1. Has its own memory store and vector store
2. Uses its own API key for AI model access
3. Uses its own Starknet wallet for blockchain interactions
4. Can run independently of other agents

### Memory Isolation

Each agent has its own isolated memory that is not shared with other agents:

- **Memory Store**: Each agent has its own in-memory store for conversation data
- **Vector Store**: Each agent has its own ChromaDB collection with a unique name based on the agent ID

This memory isolation ensures that:
- Agents don't interfere with each other's memory
- Each agent maintains its own state and context
- Agents can develop independent strategies and knowledge

### Starknet Integration

The `StarknetConfigStore` singleton maintains the configuration for each agent and ensures that blockchain operations use the correct wallet for each agent.

### Dashboard Integration

When enabled, the dashboard integration provides:
- Real-time monitoring of agent thoughts and actions
- Status updates for each agent
- Visual representation of agent activities

For more details, see the [ds-agents-dashboard](https://github.com/defi-space/ds-agents-dashboard) repository.

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new agent file in `src/agents/` (e.g., `agent4.ts`)
2. Add the agent's configuration to `.env`
3. Add a new script to `package.json` for running the agent
4. Update the agent runner if necessary

### Customizing Agent Behavior

Agent behavior can be customized by modifying:
- Context definitions in `src/contexts/`
- Available actions in `src/actions/`
- Prompts in `src/prompts/`

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

The project includes Docker Compose configuration for running the required services:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Production Deployment Considerations

For production deployment:

1. Use environment-specific configuration files
2. Set up proper monitoring and alerting
3. Implement proper logging and error tracking
4. Consider using a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications
5. Set up automatic restarts for failed processes
6. Implement proper backup strategies for databases

## Phala TEE Integration

This project supports deployment in [Phala Network's](https://phala.network/) Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing enhanced security, confidentiality, and verifiability for the agents.

### What is Phala Network?

Phala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and privacy-preserving computation using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. 
TEEs provide an isolated and secure environment where code can be executed with confidentiality and integrity guarantees, even from the host system.

### Benefits of Running Agents in Phala TEE

- **Enhanced Security**: Your agents' private keys and sensitive state are protected within the TEE, inaccessible even to the host system
- **Data Confidentiality**: All agent data, including API keys and private keys, remains encrypted and inaccessible to external observers
- **Execution Integrity**: The computation logic cannot be tampered with by malicious hosts
- **Protected State**: Agent state is protected and only accessible to authorized parties
- **On-chain Attestation**: Provides auditable logs of off-chain computations, ensuring integrity and transparency

### Phala TEE Setup Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A Phala Network account and access to the Phala Cloud
- Docker container registry account (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- Your agent credentials (API keys, wallet addresses, private keys)

### Deploying to Phala TEE

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit the .env file with your agent credentials
   ```

2. **Run the Phala Deployment Script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-to-phala.sh
   ./deploy-to-phala.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy Using Phala CLI**:
   ```bash
   phala deploy --config phala-config.json --env-file .env
   ```

4. **Monitor Your Deployment**:
   - Use Phala's dashboard to monitor your agents' health and resource usage
   - Set up alerts for any issues or performance degradation

### Phala Configuration

The project includes pre-configured files for Phala deployment:

- **Dockerfile**: Containerizes your agents for TEE deployment
- **phala-config.json**: Defines TEE environment settings, resource requirements, and security policies
- **deploy-to-phala.sh**: Automates the deployment preparation process

### Security Considerations for TEE Deployment

When deploying agents that handle private keys and sensitive operations in a TEE:

1. **Key Management**: Private keys should be securely provisioned to the TEE environment
2. **Attestation**: Verify the authenticity of the TEE environment before sending sensitive data
3. **Secure Communication**: Ensure that communication channels to and from the TEE are encrypted

### Additional Phala Resources

- [Phala Network Documentation](https://docs.phala.network/)
- [Phala Cloud Dashboard](https://app.phala.cloud)
- [TEE Security Best Practices](https://docs.phala.network/overview/phala-network)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent fails to start**:
   - Check that all required environment variables are set in `.env`
   - Ensure that the API keys are valid
   - Verify that the Starknet RPC URL is accessible

2. **ChromaDB connection errors**:
   - Ensure Docker is running
   - Check that the ChromaDB container is up (`docker-compose ps`)
   - Verify that port 8000 is accessible

3. **Starknet transaction errors**:
   - Verify that the wallet addresses and private keys are correctly formatted
   - Check that the wallets have sufficient funds
   - Ensure the Starknet RPC URL is valid and accessible

4. **Dashboard connection issues**:
   - Verify that the dashboard is running at the URL specified in `DASHBOARD_URL`
   - Check that `ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"` is set in your `.env` file
   - Ensure your agents have a valid agent ID that can be recognized by the dashboard

### Logs

For detailed logs, run agents with the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=* bun run start-agent1
```

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Private Keys**: Store private keys securely and never expose them
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control for APIs and services
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
