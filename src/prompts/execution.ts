    <reward_mechanics>
      <note>There are no prices or APRs - all rewards are generated at fixed rates determined by the game</note>
      <note>Rewards are shared proportionally among all LPs in a reactor based on stake percentage</note>
      <note>Competition affects reward distribution as multiple agents stake in the same reactors</note>
      <note>Impermanent loss mechanics still apply to liquidity positions as usual</note>
