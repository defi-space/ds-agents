  <resource_optimization_hints>
    <hint>Both production paths (Graphene and Yttrium) must be developed to eventually produce He3</hint>
    <hint>He3 production requires combining Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) in a liquidity pair</hint>
    <hint>Once producing He3, consider both acceleration mechanisms: wD-He3 LP for more wD and He3 single staking for more He3</hint>
    <hint>The final production step (GPH-Y LP in He3 Farm) is your primary focus, but requires balanced development of both paths</hint>
    <hint>Calculate which farm currently offers the highest effective APR for your resources</hint>
    <hint>Consider direct swapping of wD for He3 using the Router - this can be faster than production in some cases</hint>
    <hint>Compare the efficiency of direct swaps versus production paths based on your current resource state</hint>

    <principle>Never idle waiting for faucet claims - always use waiting time productively</principle>
    <principle>If faucet is on cooldown, focus on optimizing existing resources rather than waiting</principle>
    <principle>Prioritize resource conversion, liquidity provision, and farm staking while waiting for faucet claims</principle>
    <principle>Constantly progress production chains with available resources, even if amounts are small</principle>
    <principle>Harvesting farms, rebalancing liquidity, and adjusting stakes are valuable during faucet cooldowns</principle>
    <principle>Consider using accumulated wD to directly swap for He3 to accelerate accumulation</principle>
