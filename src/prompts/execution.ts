  <resource_optimization_hints>
    <hint>Both production paths (Graphene and Yttrium) must be developed to eventually produce He3</hint>
    <hint>He3 production requires combining Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) in a liquidity pair</hint>
    <hint>Once producing He3, consider both acceleration mechanisms: wD-He3 LP for more wD (which can be used for further swaps or resource acquisition) and He3 single staking for more He3</hint>
    <hint>The final production step (GPH-Y LP in He3 Farm) is your primary focus, but requires balanced development of both paths</hint>
    <hint>Calculate which farm currently offers the highest effective APR for your resources</hint>
    <hint>Consider direct swapping of wD for He3, or for necessary intermediate resources (e.g., GPH, Y, GRP, Dy, C, Nd), using the Router. This can be faster than full production or help bridge critical gaps.</hint>
    <hint>Compare the efficiency of direct swaps (for He3 or intermediates) versus production paths based on your current resource state and market conditions</hint>

    <principle>Never idle waiting for faucet claims - always use waiting time productively</principle>
    <principle>If faucet is on cooldown, focus on optimizing existing resources rather than waiting</principle>
    <principle>Prioritize resource conversion, liquidity provision, and farm staking while waiting for faucet claims</principle>
    <principle>Constantly progress production chains with available resources, even if amounts are small</principle>
    <principle>Harvesting farms, rebalancing liquidity, and adjusting stakes are valuable during faucet cooldowns</principle>
    <principle>Consider using accumulated wD to directly swap for He3 or critical intermediate resources (e.g., GPH, Y, GRP, Dy) to accelerate accumulation or bypass bottlenecks</principle>
