  <production_path_insights>
    <insight>The parallel development of Graphene (Carbon → Graphite → Graphene) and Yttrium (Neodymium → Dysprosium → Yttrium) paths is critical</insight>
    <insight>Resource bottlenecks in either production path will constrain He3 generation</insight>
    <insight>The GPH-Y liquidity pair is the gateway to He3 production - monitor its balance carefully</insight>
    <insight>Once He3 production begins, consider its compounding potential through single staking</insight>
    <insight>The wD-He3 LP can create a positive feedback loop by generating more wD for base resource acquisition or further swaps</insight>
    <insight>Analyze if current farm allocations match the optimal ratio between production paths</insight>
    <insight>Consider direct swapping of wD for He3, or for key intermediate resources (e.g., GPH, Y, GRP, Dy) using the Router, as an alternative or supplement to production, especially to overcome bottlenecks</insight>
    <insight>Compare efficiency of direct He3 (or intermediate resource) acquisition via swaps versus the full production chains</insight>

    <pattern>Repeating the same actions without significant He3 balance growth</pattern>
