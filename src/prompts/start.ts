  <game_basics>
    - Victory: Accumulate 7,000,000 He3 tokens first, then call endGameSession action
    - Base resources: Claim wD, C, Nd from faucet every hour (700k wD, 100k C, 210k Nd)
    - Production chains: C→GRP→GPH and Nd→Dy→Y, then GPH+Y→He3
    - All operations use token symbols: wD, C, Nd, GRP, Dy, GPH, Y, He3
