## Resource Flow and Game Logic

Understanding the complete resource flow is critical for success. wattDollar (wD) serves as the primary currency, essential for forming liquidity pairs and farming token rewards.

1. Resource Structure:

   A. Initial Base Resource Tokens (Claimable from Faucet):
      * wattDollar, Carbon, and Neodymium (wD, C, Nd) can be claimed from the Faucet contract every hour.
      - wattDollar (wD): Primary resource token, used in almost all liquidity pairs.
      - Carbon (C): Primary resource token, paired with wattDollar (wD) to farm Graphite (GRP) once staked in the reward pool.
      - Neodymium (Nd): Primary resource token, paired with wattDollar (wD) to farm Dysprosium (Dy) once staked in the reward pool.
      
   B. Intermediate Resource Tokens (Farmed with LP tokens emitted from farms paired with wattDollar):
      These are produced by depositing LP tokens into specific farm contracts. 
      Rewards (GRP, Dy, GPH, Y) can be claimed from these farms at any time, as emissions do not have a timer.
      It is important to claim these rewards as soon as possible so that they can be used to farm the next token in the chain.
      With this in mind, Helium-3 (He3) can be farmed by pairing Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) in a liquidity pair.
      For this reason, the following paths (B.1 and B.2) are required to farm the necessary tokens to eventually farm Helium-3 (He3).

      Path B.1 - Required Liquidity Pairs for Graphene (GPH) Token Farming:
      - Carbon (C) is paired with wattDollar (wD).
      - The wD/C LP token, when deposited in the Graphite (GRP) Farm, generates Graphite (GRP).
      - Graphite (GRP) is then paired with wattDollar (wD).
      - The wD/GRP LP token, when deposited in the Graphene (GPH) Farm, generates Graphene (GPH).
      
      Path B.2 - Required Liquidity Pairs for Yttrium (Y) Token Farming:
      - Neodymium (Nd) is paired with wattDollar (wD).
      - The wD/Nd LP token, when deposited in the Dysprosium (Dy) Farm, generates Dysprosium (Dy).
      - Dysprosium (Dy) is then paired with wattDollar (wD).
      - The wD/Dy LP token, when deposited in the Yittrium (Y) Farm, generates Yttrium (Y).

   C. Final Resource Token Accumlation (Helium-3 and additional wattDollar):
      Helium-3 (He3) production requires both Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y). 
      Farming Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) is paramount for He3.
      For this reason, assess the following paths (C.1, C.2, and C.3) to determine the best strategy for accumulating Helium-3 (He3) and additional wattDollar (wD).

      Path C.1 - Required Liquidity Pair for Helium-3 (He3) Token Farming:
      - Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) are combined in a liquidity pair.
      - The GPH/Y LP token, when deposited in the He3 Farm, generates Helium-3 (He3).

      Path C.2 - Additional Helium-3 (He3) Token Production:
      - Single-Sided Staking: He3 can be deposited directly into another He3 Farm (He3 Single Stake) to earn more He3.
      - This is less risky than Path C.3, however it is slower as less tokens are emitted at a slower rate.

      Path C.3 - Additional wattDollar (wD) Token Production:
      - Helium-3 (He3) paired with wattDollar (wD): The wD/He3 LP token, when deposited into its Helium-3 (He3) Farm, generates more wattDollar (wD).
      - This allows for additional wattDollar (wD) outside of the faucet hourly claim window.
      - This is a risky incentive which opens one's LP's to impermanent loss via Helium-3 (He3) being swappable, however it allows for additional swaps into tokens needed to farm additional Helium-3 (He3).

    These operations (depositing tokens into LP's, staking LP's to farms, withdrawing LP's from farms, unpairing tokens from their LP's, swapping resource tokens,and staking Helium-3 in the Single Stake Farm) can be done at any time.

2. Resource Generation Methods:

   A. Faucet Claims (Every Hour):
      - 700,000 wattDollar (wD)
      - 100,000 Carbon (C)
      - 210,000 Neodymium (Nd)
      * Balancing these hourly claims with continuous farming activities is key.

   B. Liquidity Mining Rewards & Swapping:
      Primary Production (Intermediate Resources):
      - wD/C LP token generates Graphite (GRP) in the GRP Farm.
      - wD/Nd LP token generates Dysprosium (Dy) in the Dy Farm.
      - wD/GRP LP token generates Graphene (GPH) in the GPH Farm.
      - wD/Dy LP token generates Yttrium (Y) in the Y Farm.
      * Rewards can be claimed at any time.

      Advanced Production (Final Resource & Utility):
      - GPH/Y LP token generates Helium-3 (He3) in the He3 Farm.
      - wD/He3 LP token generates wattDollar (wD) in its He3 Farm.
      - He3 (single token) generates more He3 in the He3 Single Stake Farm.
      * Rewards can be claimed at any time.

      Direct Swapping (via Router):
      - As an alternative or supplement to production, consider direct swapping of resource tokens for resources like Neodymium (Nd), Dysprosium (Dy), Carbon (C), Graphite (GRP), Graphene (GPH), and Helium-3 (He3) using the Router contract. This can be a potential shortcut.

3. Game Mechanics:

   A. Resource Progression:
      - All intermediate resources (GRP, GPH, Dy, Y) require wD for their initial liquidity pairs.
      - Both the Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) production lines must be developed.
      - He3 production is only possible by combining Graphene (GPH) and Yttrium (Y) into a liquidity pair and depositing the LP token into the Helium-3 (He3) Farm.
      - He3 enables acceleration by farming more wD or more He3.

   B. Economic Considerations:
      - Limited hourly faucet claims impose a cap on base resource influx.
      - Fixed reward pools for each farm mean yield is shared with other participants.
      - Impermanent loss is a risk in all liquidity pools.
      - Competition from other agents affects reward distribution.
      - Adding tokens to liquidity pools allows other participants to swap between those tokens, which can affect pool ratios and your holdings.

4. Victory Condition:
   - Be the first to accumulate 7,000,000 He3 tokens in your wallet.
   - Call endGameSession action to finalize the win.

6. Blockchain Error Handling

<blockchain_errors>
1. Transaction Errors:
   
   A. REJECTED Errors:
      - Usually indicates nonce synchronization issues
      - Common when rapidly submitting multiple transactions
      - Resolution:
        * Wait for previous transactions to confirm
        * Retry the transaction after a short delay
        * Consider implementing transaction queuing

   B. Gas Errors:
      - Indicates insufficient gas or network congestion
      - Resolution:
        * Retry the transaction later
        * These are normal and expected during high network activity
        * No need to modify transaction parameters, just retry

2. Balance Errors:

   A. ERC20 Insufficient Balance:
      - Indicates attempted transfer exceeds available balance
      - Resolution:
        * Decrease the transaction amount
        * For swaps: reduce the input amount
        * For liquidity: reduce the deposit amount
        * Consider leaving small buffer for gas fees

3. Best Practices:
   
   A. Transaction Management:
      - Implement exponential backoff for retries
      - Track pending transactions to prevent nonce issues
      - Consider transaction replacement (speed up) for critical operations

   B. Balance Management:
      - Always maintain buffer for gas fees
      - Start with smaller amounts when testing new strategies
      - Implement percentage-based calculations instead of fixed amounts
