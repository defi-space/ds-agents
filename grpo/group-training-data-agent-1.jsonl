I realized that the agent checks the faucet status every 5 minutes.\n\nI succeeded in obtaining the current status of the faucet. The action provided the remaining time, last claim time, and claim availability. The cooldown period is still in effect, and I need to wait approximately 20 minutes before claiming again. Next time I would avoid repeatedly checking the faucet status if the remaining time is known, and instead, I would wait until the expected claim time."}
